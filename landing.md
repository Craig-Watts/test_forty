		<p> Hello! I am Bora. I am a Bioinformatics Scientist at the 
			[Berlin Institute of Medical Systems Biology](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/bimsb) of
			the [Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine](https://www.mdc-berlin.de).

					<h3>BSc</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I decided to study Bioinformatics back in 2004 at Sabanci University (Istanbul,Turkey), where I was inspired by the freshman projects offered by <a href='http://www.sezermanlab.org' > Ugur Sezerman </a>, who is probably responsible for dozens of other people to choose to study bionformatics :). I graduated from Sabanci University in 2008 and moved to Vancouver/Canada to do my Master's degree.</p>

					<h3>MSc</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I did my Master's degree in Vancouver/Canada, where I finished a [Bioinformatics Training Program](https://bcbioinformaticsgrad.ca) jointly organized by Simon Fraser University and University of British Columbia. There, I had the chance to do rotation projects in the groups of [Cenk Sahinalp](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O8wbTncAAAAJ&hl=en), [Inanc Birol](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Svk1wjsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Marco Marra](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XTZ7_NUAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Nansheng Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tEN1cS0AAAAJ&hl=en). I wrote my Master's thesis titled "Homology and Evidence-based Genome Annotation of Caenorhabditis Species" in the group of Nansheng Chen and defended my thesis in December 2010.</p>

					<h3>PhD</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I obtained my PhD from the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](www.embl.de), where I worked in [Toby Gibson's team](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=udfEf1EAAAAJ&hl=en). I defended my doctoral thesis on "the Roles of Short Linear Motifs in Human Diseases" in the University of Heidelberg in November, 2014 and stayed in Toby's team as a bridging postdoctoral fellow until July, 2015.</p>
